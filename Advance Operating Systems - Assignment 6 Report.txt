9.1
Free Memory List is traversed and printed using the new system call printfreemem and new shell command xsh_printfreemem

9.4
1. Inorder that stack is not freed back to the free list, we have put a condition on the freestk system call in the kill method.
2. The condition is based on a flag which is set in the xsh_maxstksize.

9.7
Maximum Stack Size
1. In the create system call, the entire alloted stack is filled with dummy values -1.
2. When the stack is used, the dummy values are over written.
3. When the process is killed, we count the number of dummy values. This number is the least available space in the stack at any instance.
4. The maximum stack size can be calculated as stack length subtrcted by the number of dummy values.
5. New system call - xsh_maxstksize and dummy function testproc are used to display the result.
